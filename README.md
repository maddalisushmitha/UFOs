## Results:

## Summary:

### DrawBack
filters that are used on the website are not userfriendly and storing the information collected is not present

### Developments:
- We can make the website userfriendly by adding filters for duration, start date and end date  
- Add a sort options beside ids example ascending or descending order for date 
- We can add a export button at the bottom of the page by asking user if they want to export the results
